//Strong type checking : TypeScript: A Static Type Checker
//Compile-time error checks prevents 
//JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise level as a full-fledged server-side technology. 
//TypeScript was presented to bridge this gap.


//TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. 
//TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. 
//In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

//Why Use TypeScript?
//The benefits of TypeScript include −
//1.Compilation − JavaScript is an interpreted language. 
//Hence, it needs to be run to test that it is valid. 
//It means you write all the codes just to find no output, 
//in case there is an error. Hence, you have to spend hours trying to find bugs in the code. 
//The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. 
//TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. 
//This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.

//2.Strong Static Typing − JavaScript is not strongly typed. 
//TypeScript comes with an optional static typing and type inference system through the TLS (TypeScript Language Service). 
//The type of a variable, declared with no type, may be inferred by the TLS based on its value.

//3.TypeScript supports type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries. 
//TypeScript Definition file (with .d.ts extension) provides definition for external JavaScript libraries. 
//Hence, TypeScript code can contain these libraries.

//4.TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.


//the following command in the terminal window to install TypeScript globally.
//npm install -g typescript
//You can test your install by checking the version.
//tsc --version

//error: tsc.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
//solution: 
//1. Open Powershell run as Administrator
//2. Then type : set-executionpolicy remotesigned
//3. And select option : A
//4. try again Type: tsc --version


//A TypeScript program is composed of:
    //Modules
    //Functions
    //Variables
    //Statements and Expressions
    //Comments

//======== compile typescript file and run =========//
//$ tsc helloworld.ts
//# helloworld.ts => helloworld.js
//node example.js

//or

//$npm i ts-node
//$ts-node example.ts
